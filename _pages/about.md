I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/) at [Florida State University](https://www.fsu.edu/), supervised by [Dr. Jie Yang](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~jieyang/). Prior to joining FSU, I received M.S. from the School of Electronics and Information Engineering at Beihang University.

My research interests include mobile computing and cybersecurity. Currently, I mainly focus on wireless sensing, earables sensing, user authentication, and human biometrics.
